Morgan, you are an absolutely gifted writer, a phenominal free-thinker, a secret and cynical comedian, an exceptionally empathetic and loving friend. Most importantly Morgan, you are a much-better-than-you-give-yourself-credit-for **ARTIST**. And you deserve a place in the digital realm to not only show your work, but to share your remarkable voice.

And so, I gift to you, your very own portfolio site.

I kept it incredibly clean, and minimalistic, which I think would speak to your aesthetic. It's built with some awesome technologies that will make it modular and easy to upgrade and update in the future. I've also purchased for you [morganbalog.com](morganbalog.com) && my personal favorite: [morganemmettbalog.com](morganemmettbalog.com). The former points to the later. They're good for a year and I'll help transfer them into your name.

There are a few sample pages to demonstrate page creation and inter-linking through markdown files. It's a super easy way to write content symantically and I can show you how to create new pages with them.

A huge shout out to Bryan Bove. He wrote your wonderful About me page. Between the way the two of you string together sentances, it makes me want to be a better artist myself. _#YW_

**<3 Mike**
